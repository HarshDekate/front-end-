# Responsive Internal Landing Page Design

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a responsive internal landing page for an organization. The goal is to develop a landing page that looks and functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. This README provides details on how to set up, develop, and deploy the project, along with guidelines for ensuring the code meets the required standards.

## Project Details

### Assignment Details

- **Task:** Develop a responsive landing page based on the provided Figma design.
- **Timeline:** Complete the assignment within 2 days.

### Requirements

1. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the landing page adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
2. **Pixel-Perfect Implementation:** Create a pixel-perfect representation of the Figma design.
3. **Images and Assets:** Optimize and use images and assets efficiently to maintain fast loading times.
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
5. **Validation:** Ensure HTML and CSS are valid and follow best practices.
6. **Performance:** Optimize the landing page for performance, including lazy loading of assets.
7. **Accessibility:** Ensure the landing page is accessible and follows WCAG guidelines.
8. **Code Authenticity:** AI-generated code will not be accepted.

## Development Guidelines

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landing-page.git
   cd landing-page
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

### Project Structure

Ensure your project structure is organized as follows:

```
landing-page/
│
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── scripts.js
├── images/
│   └── (optimized images)
├── assets/
│   └── (additional assets)
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

### Development Steps

1. **HTML Development:**
   - Create a semantic HTML structure based on the Figma design.
   - Ensure the use of appropriate HTML5 tags and attributes.

2. **CSS Development:**
   - Develop the styles in `css/styles.css`.
   - Implement responsive design using media queries.
   - Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.

3. **JavaScript Development:**
   - Add interactivity and functionality in `js/scripts.js`.
   - Ensure the JavaScript enhances the user experience but does not interfere with the content accessibility.

4. **Image Optimization:**
   - Optimize images for fast loading times.
   - Use appropriate formats (JPEG, PNG, SVG) and resolutions.

5. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Test the landing page on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - Ensure consistent appearance and functionality.

6. **Validation and Best Practices:**
   - Validate HTML and CSS using W3C validation tools.
   - Follow best practices for coding standards and maintain clean code.

7. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement lazy loading for images and other assets.
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript files.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure the landing page follows WCAG guidelines.
   - Use ARIA roles and attributes where necessary.
